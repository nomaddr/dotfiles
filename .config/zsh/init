# This file contains integrations for mise, zoxide, and fzf,
# migrated from your original Bash 'init' section.
# It is sourced by your main ~/.zshrc.

# --- Mise (rtx) Integration ---
# Mise automatically detects Zsh and provides the correct activation script.
if command -v mise &> /dev/null; then
  eval "$(mise activate zsh)"
fi

# --- Zoxide Integration ---
# Zoxide also automatically detects Zsh and provides the correct initialization script.
if command -v zoxide &> /dev/null; then
  eval "$(zoxide init zsh)"
fi

# --- FZF Integration ---
# Oh My Zsh's 'fzf' plugin (enabled in ~/.zshrc) handles most of this.
# However, if you're not using OMZ's fzf plugin or want to ensure specific paths,
# you could add them here. For a standard OMZ setup, the plugin is sufficient.
# The original Bash paths for fzf completions/key-bindings were:
# /usr/share/bash-completion/completions/fzf
# /usr/share/fzf/key-bindings.bash
# For Zsh, these are typically handled by OMZ's fzf plugin, or found at:
# /usr/share/fzf/shell/completion.zsh
# /usr/share/fzf/shell/key-bindings.zsh
# If you are NOT using the 'fzf' plugin in Oh My Zsh, uncomment and use these:
# if [[ -f /usr/share/fzf/shell/completion.zsh ]]; then
#   source /usr/share/fzf/shell/completion.zsh
# fi
# if [[ -f /usr/share/fzf/shell/key-bindings.zsh ]]; then
#   source /usr/share/fzf/shell/key-bindings.zsh
# fi
