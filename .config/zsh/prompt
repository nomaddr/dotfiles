# This file defines your Zsh prompt, migrated from your Bash 'prompt' file.
# Zsh's prompt system is different from Bash's.

# Bash-specific variables like force_color_prompt and color_prompt are removed.
# Zsh handles colors in prompts differently.

# Basic Zsh prompt:
# %n: username
# %m: hostname up to first dot
# %~: current working directory (tildified)
# %#: '#' for root, '%' for normal user
# You can customize this heavily or use an Oh My Zsh theme.
PROMPT='[%~]\uf0a9 '

# Function to set the terminal window/pane title (similar to your Bash PS1 setup)
# This uses Zsh's precmd function, which runs before each prompt.
precmd() {
  # Set the terminal title to the current working directory
  print -P "\e]0;%~\a"
}

# If you want a more advanced prompt, consider installing powerlevel10k
# and configuring it in your ~/.zshrc.
