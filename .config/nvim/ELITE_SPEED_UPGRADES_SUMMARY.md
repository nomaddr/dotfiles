# 🚀 ELITE SPEED UPGRADES - What I Just Added

## ⚡ Your Config is Now 10/10 ELITE STATUS!

I've added **8 categories of elite speed optimizations** to your `lua/config/keymaps.lua` file. Here's exactly what you gained:

---

## 🎯 **1. Quick Escape (ThePrimeagen's Signature Move)**
```lua
jk  - Exit insert mode (no more reaching for Esc!)
kj  - Alternative exit (in case you type backwards)
```
**Why Elite:** Never break flow reaching for Esc key. Stay in home row position.

---

## 💾 **2. Quick Save (Universal Elite Pattern)**
```lua
<leader>w  - Save file (normal mode)
<C-s>      - Save file (works in any mode)
<C-s>      - Save from insert mode (exits insert, saves, stays in normal)
```
**Why Elite:** Instant muscle memory save. Works like every other editor but faster.

---

## 🎯 **3. Centered Navigation (ThePrimeagen's Secret Sauce)**
```lua
<C-d>  - Half page down (cursor stays centered)
<C-u>  - Half page up (cursor stays centered)  
n      - Next search result (centered)
N      - Previous search result (centered)
```
**Why Elite:** Never lose track of cursor position. Reduces cognitive load massively.

---

## ⚡ **4. Power User Quick Access**
```lua
<leader><leader>  - Quick find files (double-tap space)
<leader>/         - Quick search in project
```
**Why Elite:** Most-used actions get the fastest access. Double-space is lightning fast.

---

## 📝 **5. Better Line Movement (Visual Mode Support)**
```lua
<A-j>  - Move line down (normal mode)
<A-k>  - Move line up (normal mode)
<A-j>  - Move selection down (visual mode)
<A-k>  - Move selection up (visual mode)
```
**Why Elite:** Enhanced version of your existing Alt+j/k with proper visual mode support.

---

## 🧭 **6. Smart Line Navigation**
```lua
j  - Move down by visual line (handles wrapped lines)
k  - Move up by visual line (handles wrapped lines)
```
**Why Elite:** Natural movement through wrapped text. No more jumping over long lines.

---

## 🪟 **7. Quick Window Management**
```lua
<leader>sv  - Split vertically
<leader>sh  - Split horizontally  
<leader>sx  - Close current split
```
**Why Elite:** Fast window operations without remembering Ctrl+w combinations.

---

## 📐 **8. Better Indenting (Stay in Visual Mode)**
```lua
<  - Indent left and reselect (visual mode)
>  - Indent right and reselect (visual mode)
```
**Why Elite:** Indent multiple times without re-selecting. Huge time saver.

## 🏆 **IMMEDIATE BENEFITS YOU'LL NOTICE:**

### **Muscle Memory Improvements:**
- ✅ **No more Esc key** - Use `jk` instead
- ✅ **Instant saves** - `<leader>w` or `Ctrl+S`
- ✅ **Never lose cursor** - Centered navigation
- ✅ **Lightning file access** - Double-space to find files

### **Workflow Speed Boosts:**
- ✅ **Faster text editing** - Better line movement and indenting
- ✅ **Smoother navigation** - Smart line movement through wrapped text
- ✅ **Quicker window management** - Simple split commands
- ✅ **Reduced cognitive load** - Cursor always centered

---

## 🎮 **HOW TO PRACTICE THESE NEW SUPERPOWERS:**

### **Day 1-3: Master the Basics**
1. **Force yourself to use `jk`** instead of Esc (muscle memory takes 3 days)
2. **Use `<leader>w`** for every save
3. **Try `<leader><leader>`** for file finding

### **Day 4-7: Advanced Techniques**
1. **Use centered navigation** (`<C-d>`, `<C-u>`)
2. **Practice line movement** with `<A-j>/<A-k>`
3. **Master visual indenting** with `</>` 

### **Week 2+: Elite Status**
1. **Combine techniques** - `jk` + `<leader>w` + `<leader><leader>`
2. **Use quick search** with `<leader>/`
3. **Window management** with `<leader>sv/sh/sx`
