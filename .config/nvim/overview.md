# Your Neovim Configuration Overview

This document provides an overview of your Neovim configuration, which is a powerful and feature-rich setup tailored for a wide range of development tasks, from web development to systems and even game development with C/C++.

---

## Understanding Your Neovim Configuration Structure

Your configuration is structured using **Lazy.nvim**, which is a popular and efficient plugin manager. The `lua/config/lazy.lua` file is the core of your setup, telling Neovim where to find all your plugins and how to load them.

The setup leverages a "starter" configuration (likely based on **LazyVim** or a similar distribution), which provides a lot of default functionality. Your other `.lua` files in `lua/plugins/` and `lua/config/` then add to or override those defaults in a modular way.

---

## Overview of Installed & Configured Plugins

Your setup covers several key areas:

### 1. Core Language & Development Support (from the main `lazy.lua` block)

This section sets up your core development environment with powerful language and tooling support.

* **`neovim/nvim-lspconfig`**: This is the client that enables Neovim to communicate with **Language Servers (LSPs)**. LSPs provide intelligent code features like:
    * Autocompletion
    * Go-to-definition
    * Hover information
    * Code refactoring
    * Real-time diagnostics (errors, warnings)
    * **Configured LSP Servers**:
        * **Web Development**: `tsserver` (TypeScript/JavaScript), `tailwindcss`, `html`, `cssls`, `emmet_ls`, `jsonls`.
        * **Systems & DevOps**: `bashls` (Bash), `yamlls` (YAML), `dockerls` (Dockerfiles), `terraformls` (Terraform/HCL).
        * **Documentation & Config**: `marksman` (Markdown), `lemminx` (XML), `taplo` (TOML).
        * **Programming Languages**: `lua_ls` (for your Neovim config itself!), `clangd` (C/C++), `gopls` (Go), `pyright` (Python), `jdtls` (Java).

* **`nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter`**: This plugin provides a powerful **syntax parsing engine** that understands code structure much more accurately than traditional regex. It enables advanced syntax highlighting, intelligent text object selection, and more.
    * **Installed Parsers**: You've configured it to ensure parsers are installed for virtually all the languages you have LSP servers for, plus useful ones like `vim`, `vimdoc`, `query`, and `regex`.

* **`williamboman/mason.nvim`**: This is a **package manager specifically for development tools**. It simplifies the installation and management of LSP servers, formatters, linters, and debuggers.
    * **Ensured Tools**: Mason is set to automatically install all the LSP servers listed above, plus a wide array of **formatters** (`prettier`, `stylua`, `shfmt`, `black`, `isort`, `gofumpt`, `clang-format`, `yamlfmt`, `google-java-format`) and **linters** (`eslint_d`, `shellcheck`, `flake8`, `golangci-lint`, `hadolint`).

### 2. Coding Quality of Life (`./lua/plugins/coding.lua`)

This file contains plugins that enhance your daily coding experience, with a focus on web and C/C++ development.

* **`windwp/nvim-ts-autotag`**: Automatically closes HTML/XML tags and renames paired tags as you type, leveraging Treesitter for precision.
* **`windwp/nvim-autopairs`**: Automatically inserts matching parentheses, brackets, and quotes, with Treesitter awareness to prevent unwanted pairings (e.g., inside strings).
* **`norcalli/nvim-colorizer.lua`**: Provides visual highlighting for color codes (hex, RGB, HSL) directly in your code, which is highly useful for web development.
* **`barrett-ruth/live-server.nvim`**: Offers a simple live-reloading development server for web projects, similar to popular IDE extensions.
* **`rest-nvim/rest.nvim`**: A Neovim client for testing REST APIs. You can define HTTP requests in a file and execute them directly from your editor.
* **`vuki656/package-info.nvim`**: Displays information about `package.json` dependencies (e.g., outdated versions) directly in your buffer.
* **`mlaursen/vim-react-snippets`**: Provides common React code snippets, integrated with **LuaSnip** (a popular snippet engine).
* **`p00f/clangd_extensions.nvim`**: Enhances `clangd` (the C/C++ LSP) with advanced features like **inlay hints** (showing types, parameters inline) and **Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)** visualization.
* **`Civitasv/cmake-tools.nvim`**: Integrates the CMake build system management directly into Neovim, allowing you to generate, build, run, and debug CMake-based C/C++ projects.
* **`mfussenegger/nvim-dap` (with `nvim-dap-ui` and `nvim-dap-virtual-text`)**: This is your comprehensive **Debugger Adapter Protocol (DAP)** setup.
    * **`nvim-dap`**: The core debugger client.
    * **`nvim-dap-ui`**: Provides a graphical user interface for debugging, showing variables, call stack, breakpoints, etc.
    * **`nvim-dap-virtual-text`**: Displays variable values and expressions inline as virtual text during debugging sessions.
    * It's configured specifically for C/C++ using the `codelldb` debugger adapter.

### 3. Tmux Integration (`./lua/plugins/tmux.lua`)

* **`christoomey/vim-tmux-navigator`**: Enables seamless and consistent navigation between Neovim panes and Tmux panes using the same keybindings (`C-h`, `C-l`, `C-j`, `C-k`).

### 4. Note-Taking and Knowledge Base (`./lua/plugins/obsidian.lua`)

* **`obsidian-nvim/obsidian.nvim`**: This plugin transforms Neovim into a powerful client for managing Obsidian Markdown vaults. It supports features like linking notes, daily notes, tag management, and more within your vault.
    * **`completion = { nvim_cmp = false, blink = true, ... }`**: This is a key part of your earlier confusion. `obsidian.nvim` has built-in support for autocompletion using `nvim-cmp`.
        * `nvim_cmp = false`: This explicitly disables `obsidian.nvim`'s *default* way of integrating with `nvim-cmp`.
        * `blink = true`: This tells `obsidian.nvim` to use a *specific completion source* or *integration* named "blink" for its autocompletion features (e.g., suggesting note links or tags). This "blink" is **not a separate plugin**, but rather a custom `nvim-cmp` source or setup provided by the *preconfigured Neovim distribution* you are using. It's designed to provide `obsidian.nvim`-specific suggestions via your main `nvim-cmp` setup.

### 5. Code Formatting and Linting (`./lua/plugins/formatting.lua`)

This file ensures your code adheres to style guides and catches potential issues.

* **`stevearc/conform.nvim`**: This is your **code formatter manager**. It integrates various external formatters (which Mason helps install) and applies them to your code.
    * **Formatters by Filetype**: Configured to use `prettier` (web files), `stylua` (Lua), `black`/`isort` (Python), `gofumpt` (Go), `clang-format` (C/C++), `yamlfmt` (YAML), `google-java-format` (Java), and `shfmt` (shell scripts).
* **`mfussenegger/nvim-lint`**: This is your **code linter manager**. It integrates various external linters (also managed by Mason) to provide real-time feedback on potential errors, style issues, and best practices.
    * **Linters by Filetype**: Configured with `eslint_d` (JS/TS), `flake8` (Python), `golangci-lint` (Go), `shellcheck` (shell scripts), and `hadolint` (Dockerfiles).

### 6. Visual Style Adjustments (`./lua/plugins/style.lua`)

* This small configuration hooks into your overall LazyVim setup to **disable italic fonts** for various syntax elements (keywords, functions, variables, types). This is useful if your chosen colorscheme uses italics in a way you dislike.

### 7. Animation Control (`./lua/plugins/snacks-animated-scrolling-off.lua`)

* **`folke/snacks.nvim`**: This plugin is a collection of small "snack" features from Folke, the creator of Lazy.nvim.
    * **`scroll = { enabled = false }`**: This specific configuration **disables the animated scrolling feature** that `snacks.nvim` can provide. This means your scrolling jumps will be instant, not smooth.
    * **`snacks.picker`**: Similar to `blink.cmp`, "snacks.picker" isn't a separate plugin. It refers to a *feature* or *module* within the `snacks.nvim` plugin. While your configuration explicitly disables the scrolling animation, `snacks.nvim` offers other functionalities, and "picker" likely refers to one of them, which might be enabled by default or used by your base LazyVim setup.

### 8. Custom Keymaps (`./lua/config/keymaps.lua`)

This file defines all your custom keyboard shortcuts.

* It extends and overrides LazyVim's default keymaps.
* **Tmux Navigation**: Seamless window movement between Neovim and Tmux using `C-h`, `C-l`, `C-j`, `C-k`.
* **"Elite Speed Optimizations"**: These are common, highly efficient keybindings often promoted by power users:
    * **Quick Escape**: `jk` or `kj` to exit insert mode quickly.
    * **Quick Save**: `<leader>w` and `C-s` to save files.
    * **Centered Navigation**: `C-d`/`C-u` (half page up/down) and search results (`n`/`N`) will keep the cursor in the middle of the screen for better context.
    * **Power User Quick Access**: `<leader><leader>` for file searching (`Telescope find_files`) and `<leader>/` for project-wide searching (`Telescope live_grep`).
    * **Better Line Movement**: `Alt-j` and `Alt-k` to move lines up/down (also in visual mode for blocks).
    * **Smart Line Navigation**: `j` and `k` move by visual lines (useful for wrapped lines).
    * **Quick Window Management**: `<leader>sv` (vertical split), `<leader>sh` (horizontal split), `<leader>sx` (close split).
    * **Better Indenting**: `<` and `>` in visual mode reselect the text after indenting.

### In Summary

You have a very powerful and well-equipped Neovim setup! It's designed to be a highly productive environment for a wide array of programming tasks, providing robust language support, intelligent coding assistance, debugging capabilities, and efficient navigation. The "blink.cmp" and "snacks.picker" references are likely internal naming conventions or specific feature modules within the larger `nvim-cmp` and `folke/snacks.nvim` plugins, respectively, as managed by your underlying Neovim distribution.
